Hey Frank don't give up seeking for the truth. Also there is no one deserves God's grace. All churches in this world has some issues. Some has many. some others has few. The truth is that we we struggle. 

  

Romans 5:8 says  "But God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners" 

  

Could the Chinese church you talked about not perfect? Yes, they are not perfect. But does Jesus love them? Yes He does. Does Jesus love you when your love for Jesus is not perfect? The answer is yes, Jesus still loves you. He wants all of us to turn our ways, our mind, and our actions to Him. Because He is our only hope. In Him we can love one another who are not perfect. Only by Jesus's love we can truly serve and love one another.  

  

My advice and challenge for you is not make any judgment against other people also don't make any judgment against your self either!  

  

In 1 Corinthians 4:3‭-‬4, Paul says 

  

"But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself. For I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who judges me." 

  

Paul did not even judge himself because he understood that Jesus is the only one who will judge him correctly and accurately and Jesus will judge everyone on this earth.  

  

So my brother, we were imperfect, weak, and sinner but now we are forgive by Christ and the Holy Spirit dwell in those who believe in Jesus Christ. So we can now always run to Jesus who is the perfector of our faith.  

  

Do don't be discouraged. We all have much to learn how to walk in faith. Growth doesn't happen in just a moment but it takes time and effort. Proud of you that you are thinking about these matters and struggling which means you are trying. Don't do it by yourself.. humble yourself and ask help from God and from others. 

Also with Chinese church, if you made mistake, go talk to them and ask for forgiveness.  You can tell them honestly by saying you are trying to find what is truth and you did not mean to say bad things about them and it was mistake. If you do this, you will be fine.
